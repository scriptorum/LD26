##GOAL
In as few shots as possible, fill all three fireworks with enough orb mass to fill them all up with color. 

##HOW TO PLAY 
1. Hold SPACE to start the orb mass splitting. 
2. Release SPACE to fire the separated orb mass from the main mass, in the direction of the irritatingly rotating gun. 
3. Tap SPACE to switch between active orb masses. 
4. Press R to restart the game. 
5. Large separated orb masses fire slower. Small masses go farther. 

###TIP
Aim 180 degrees away from the target, hold, and release when pointed at the target, for a good balance of orb size and distance.

###WHINING
Ran out of time for an intro screen or game over screen or score screen or randomized levels. Ah well!
